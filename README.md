# Blockchain Lottery System with User-Friendly Frontend

Welcome to our Blockchain Lottery System! This project combines the transparency and security of blockchain technology with a user-friendly frontend interface to create a seamless and enjoyable lottery experience for users.

## Note

This lottery system is built using Solidity version 0.8.11.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Our lottery system is built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and security throughout the lottery process. The smart contract manages ticket purchases, prize distribution, and result verification.

- **User-Friendly Frontend**: The frontend interface provides an intuitive platform for users to participate in the lottery, check results, and manage prizes effortlessly. The interface is designed to enhance the overall user experience, making it accessible to both experienced blockchain users and newcomers.

- **Transparency**: With blockchain technology, every transaction and lottery drawing is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record of the entire lottery process. Users can verify the fairness of the lottery results at any time.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the frontend interface and interact with the blockchain. Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

2. **Deploy Smart Contract**: Deploy the smart contract onto your preferred blockchain network. You can find the deployment script in the root directory of the project. Customize the deployment parameters as needed, then run the script to deploy the contract.

3. **Set Up Frontend**: Clone or download the frontend interface code from our repository. Update the necessary configurations to connect the frontend to the deployed smart contract.

4. **Testing**: Test the lottery system by participating in the lottery, checking results, and managing prizes through the frontend interface. The test scripts are located in the `tests` folder. To run the tests, use the command `npm run test`.

5. **Deployment**: Once testing is complete, deploy the frontend interface to a web server or hosting platform of your choice.
